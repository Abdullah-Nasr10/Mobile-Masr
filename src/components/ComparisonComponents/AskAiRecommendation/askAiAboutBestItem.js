                                IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE RULES:
                                - You may use your general knowledge about well-known device models and brands.
                                - You are not limited strictly to the provided fields.
                                - If some specifications are missing, infer them reasonably based on model reputation.
                                - Do NOT claim real-time internet access.

                                TASK:
                                - Compare products from the SAME category: "${categoryName}"
                                - User-selected main criterion: "${criteria}"

                                SCORING LOGIC:
                                - Total score = (80% main criterion) + (20% price vs value)
                                - Better specs for lower price = higher score
                                - Overpriced products get lower score
                                - The cheapest product should NOT automatically win

                                CRITERIA DETAILS RULES:
                                - For EACH product, return exactly TWO related details based on the selected criteria.
                                - Use the following fixed structure for details:

                                details: {
                                primaryLabel: string,
                                primaryValue: string,
                                secondaryLabel: string,
                                secondaryValue: string
                                }

                                - The labels must be logically consistent with the selected criteria.
                                - The structure and field names MUST remain EXACTLY the same for all criteria.

                                ANALYSIS RULES:
                                1. Score each product from 0 to 100.
                                2. Scores must be realistic and relative.
                                3. Consider both performance and price efficiency.
                                4. Choose ONE best product based on highest final score.
                                5. Use provided data + general device knowledge.

                                - Return valid JSON only.
                                - No text outside JSON.
